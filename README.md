# Horses Or Humans Autoencoder
 Horses or humans is a famous tensorflow dataset that contains animated images of horses and humans. I use autoencoders to encode and reconstruct images of humans.
 
 The reconstruction process can be improved but considering the fact that the dataset contains a small number of human images
 i think the model did a prety good job.
